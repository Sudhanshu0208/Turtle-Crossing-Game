# Turtle-Road-Crossing Game

In this project, I have made a game of a turtle crossing a road and trying to avoid obstacles. This game has levels, and each time you complete a level, the speed of the obstacles approaching the turtle increases. This project has been made easier to read by the use of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
